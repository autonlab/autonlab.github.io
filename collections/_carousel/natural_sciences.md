title:  "AI x Natural Sciences & Knowledge Discovery"
summary: "How can we immerse AI solutions in well-established fields of science and engineering to benefit them from the promise of AI? Automation can increase throughput and efficiency of processing vast amounts of data that informs scientific thinking. Assisted discovery can accelerate the scientific process. Among many interesting challenges that occur at the intersection of AI and fundamental sciences is the need to bridge the gap between data-driven policy and empirical science. Natural sciences evolve as our collective understanding of the universe increases, therefore it is important to ensure that AI can leverage this ever-increasing knowledge. We wish for it to be able to absorb it in its native declarative form while still being able to corroborate and contextualize these fundamental concepts using the currently prevalent AI process of learning from data."

    blurb: "Nature may resist a simple description, and the most important discoveries of the next century may be complex theories with countless variables and parameters. The era of big data opens up a promising new approach to scientific discovery. We develop statistical and machine learning methods for using observed and simulated data to advance cosmology. For instance, Bayesian Optimization based active-learning methods can accelerate both the execution of the cosmological simulations and the search for best-fitting parameters that describe the observed data. Many cosmology and other science applications require AI methods that can operate on complex objects such as functions, distributions, sets, or point clouds. The goal of this line of our work is to make fundamental contributions in machine learning, statistics, and cosmology, and then apply them to other natural sciences."

    blurb: "Physics-informed machine learning can build good models faster and/or with less evidence from data. Auton Lab works with physicists to make fundamental contributions to physical science, ranging from reinforcement learning for plasma control policies in nuclear fusion to high fidelity synthetic data generation governed by the laws of physics."

    blurb: "In applications such as molecule design or drug discovery, it is desirable to have an algorithm which recommends new candidate molecules based on the results of past tests. The resulting molecules first need to be synthesized and then tested for objective properties. Auton Lab developed ChemBO, a Bayesian optimization framework for generating and optimizing organic molecules for desired molecular properties."

It seems like the first half of the work with LLNL should fall under this fundamental physics x ML category, and the second half falls under radiation safety
