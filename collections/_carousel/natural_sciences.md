title:  "AI x Natural Sciences & Knowledge Discovery"
summary: "How can other fields can benefit from the promise of AI? Automation can increase efficiency of processing vast amounts of data that informs scientific thinking. Part of the challenge involves bridging the gap between data-driven policy and empirical science. Natural sciences evolve as our collective understanding of the universe increases, therefore it is important to ensure that AI can leverage this ever-increasing knowledge."

    blurb: "Nature may resist a simple description, and the most important discoveries of the next century may be complex theories with countless variables and parameters. The era of big data opens up a promising new approach to scientific discovery. We develop statistical and machine learning methods for using observed and simulated data to advance machine learning with applications to cosmology. Bayesian Optimization based active-learning methods accelearte both the execution of the cosmological simulations and the search for best-fitting parameters. Many cosmology and other science applications require ML methods that can operate on more complex objects such as functions, distributions, or set and point clouds. The goal of this work is to make fundamental contributions in machine learning, statistics, and cosmology."

    blurb: "Physics-informed machine learning builds good models faster. The lab works with physicists to make fundamental contributions to physical science, ranging from reinforcement learning for plasma control policies for nuclear fusion to high fidelity synthetic data generation governed by the laws of physics."

    blurb: "In applications such as molecule design or drug discovery, it is desirable to have an algorithm which recommends new candidate molecules based on the results of past tests. Thsee molecules first need to be synthesized and then tested for objective properties. Auton Lab developed ChemBO, a Bayesian optimization framework for generating and optimizing organic molecules for desired molecular properties."

It seems like the first half of the work with LLNL should fall under this fundamental physics x ML category, and the second half falls under radiation safety
