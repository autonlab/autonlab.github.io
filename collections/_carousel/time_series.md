title:  "Time-series Intelligence"
summary: "We frequently encounter time dependent, sequential data of observations prior to an event of interest. The structure of this data can vary wildly, from structured but haphazardly sampled observations, high frequency, multivariate sensor data, or video data. We are interested in using this data to predict future events, detect anomalies, quantify risks, and explain anomalies."

Discovery of what groups are most responsive to which actions may be difficult to ascertain due to censoring.
