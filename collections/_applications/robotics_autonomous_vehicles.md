    blurb: "Systems that operate in clinical theaters take many forms. Our work ranges from technology that supports physical robots that perform needle insertion to devices that measure vitals of patients in intensive care and forecast future episodes that will require emergency care. We develop systems that perform closed loop control of medial procedures such as fluid resuscitation, and monitoring quality of data collected at the bedside and reliability of healthcare equipment."
