    blurb: "Systems that operate in clinical theaters take many forms. Our work ranges from technology that enables physical robots to perform safe needle insertion into veins or arteries, to devices that measure vitals of patients in intensive care and forecast future episodes that might require emergency care, to new types of sensors that help quantify the state of health of human subjects. We also develop systems for closed loop control of medical procedures such as fluid resuscitation, and tools for assessing quality of data collected at the bedside and monitoring reliability of healthcare equipment."
