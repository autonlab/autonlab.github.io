    blurb: "Systems that operate in clinical theaters take many forms. Our work ranges from technology that enables physical robots to perform safe needle insertion into veins or arteries, to devices that measure vitals of patients in intensive care and forecast future episodes that might require emergency care, to new types of sensors that help quantify the state of health of human subjects. We also develop systems for closed loop control of medical procedures such as fluid resuscitation, and tools for assessing quality of data collected at the bedside and monitoring reliability of healthcare equipment."

    blurb: "When using reinforcement learning in safety-critical applications, robustness, the probability of an agent not landing in irreversible and catastrophic states (i.e. collision), plays a crucial role in determining product viability. However, as an agent's performance improves, it becomes rare to encounter and collect data on the long tail of scenarios in which the agent does poorly, hence resulting in the remaining 10% of the scenarios being significantly more difficult compared to learning to solve the first 90% of the scenarios. Our work focuses on using curriculum learning and genetic algorithms to sample-efficiently train an RL agent against the long tail of scenarios."
