    name: Cosmology

    blurb: "Nature may resist a simple description, and the most important discoveries of the next century may be complex theories with countless variables and parameters. The era of big data opens up a promising new approach to scientific discovery. We develop statistical and machine learning methods for using observed and simulated data to advance machine learning with applications to cosmology. Bayesian Optimization based active-learning methods accelearte both the execution of the cosmological simulations and the search for best-fitting parameters. Many cosmology and other science applications require ML methods that can operate on more complex objects such as functions, distributions, or set and point clouds. The goal of this work is to make fundamental contributions in machine learning, statistics, and cosmology."

    blurb: "Physics-informed machine learning builds good models faster. The lab works with physicists to make fundamental contributions to physical science, ranging from reinforcement learning for plasma control policies for nuclear fusion to high fidelity synthetic data generation governed by the laws of physics."

Info on RL for plasma control from Viraj's thesis proposal https://www.ri.cmu.edu/event/on-sample-efficient-reinforcement-learning-for-nuclear-fusion/
It seems like the first half of the work with LLNL should fall under this fundamental physics x ML category, and the second half falls under radiation safety
