title:  "Health Care & Public Health"
summary: "Auton Lab performs research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare.  Research efforts range from mining new biomedical imaging modalities for learnable structure, to forecasting cardio-respiratory instabilities from continuous vital sign measurements, to public health efforts aimed at modeling outbreak detection and testing policy interventions to determine a course of action."

    name: Public Health Surveillance
    anchor: phs
    blurb: "The Auton Lab develops statistical inference model in a long-term joint research collaboration with epidemiologists and infection prevention experts from the University of Pittsburgh. Our algorithms detect systematic outbreaks and identify root causes by joining disparate sources of information such as genetic tests, patient electronic health records (EHRs), and other epidemiological information. Leveraging multiple data sources, our algorithms establish corroborating evidence to support or dismiss hypothetical outbreak scenarios, both increasing detectability and speed of analysis while maintaining low false alert rates. We also perform analytics to detect and forecast new positive cases of COVID-19 using microbiological testing of wastewater and develop a systematic analysis capability that the Allegheny County Health Department will use in daily practice for public health surveillance."

    name: Critical Care Medicine
    anchor: icm
    blurb: "Critical Care Medicine, from initial incident and response to emergency room discharge or hospital admission in urban, rural, and field settings, is a challenging domain for machine learning. These incidents arise in routine emergency medicine operations as well as in large scale crises, inlcluding natural disasters, mass casualty incidents, emerging pandemics, and terrorist events, each putting unique demands and stresses on provision of the necessary care. The nature of the emergency involves unpredictability of demand for services, varying severity of cases, need for rapid assessment, and required persistent availability of stand-by resources. It puts a physical, cognitive and emotional strain on performers, exacerbating risk of human errors."

    name: Field Medicine
    anchor: tracir
    blurb: "Using cutting edge research and technologies, CMU develops techniques and systems intended to rapidly triage and stabilize injuries sustained in high-risk areas, particularly the battlefield or during military operations. Automated diagnosis and detection of injuries can quickly identify problems, with the eventual goal of automatic medical kits to stabilize soldiers and victims of disasters until qualified help can arrive."

    name: Biomedical Imaging
    anchor: bmi
    blurb: "We develop algorithms to leverage structure in images and videos. This intelligent featurization enables interpretable, downstream modeling."

summary: "Hospital acquired infections are a significant yet preventable detractor of patient care. The Auton lab develops statistical models for joining disparate sources of information such as genetic tests, patient histories, geography, and other epidemiological information for detecting systematic outbreaks and identifying root cause. Leveraging multiple data sources, our algorithms establish corroborating evidence to support or dismiss hypothetical outbreak scenarios, both increasing detectability and speed of analysis while maintaining low false alert rates."
