title:  "Predictive Maintenance"
summary: Predictive Maintenance in the Auton lab focuses on applying machine learning to complex, critical systems such as aircraft, spacecraft, automobiles, and biological systems. With over 15 years of experience in predictive maintenance,  we focus on reducing risks of unforeseen issues , reducing false positives in detection systems, and forecasting future failures of individual components. Common challenges in our predictive maintenance work include multi-modal data sources (e.g. text data describing failures combined with time series data from sensors), severe class imbalances due to existing maintenance processes, censored labels, and a general sparsity of labeled data. To overcome these challenges, work closely with end users and subject matter experts and use weak learning and weak supervision to rapidly construct large datasets, we use time series analysis to predict component failures, and use anomaly detection methods to discover outbreaks in the fleet.
