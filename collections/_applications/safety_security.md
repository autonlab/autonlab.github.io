title:  "Safety & Security"
summary: "Projects in this application area represent a variety of critical contexts for artificial intelligence and machine learning that are collaborations with government sponsors at the local, state, and federal level. In addition to deploying intelligent systems, part of the work in this context is defining ways to modernize existing processes to produce data that is AI-ready."

    name: Predictive Maintenance of Equipment
    anchor: pmx
    image: "/assets/images/predictive.jpg"
    blurb: "Predictive Maintenance in the Auton Lab focuses on applying machine learning to complex, critical systems such as aircraft, spacecraft, automobiles, and biological systems. With over 15 years of experience in predictive maintenance, we focus on reducing risks of unforeseen issues, reducing false positives in detection systems, and forecasting future failures of individual components. Common challenges in our predictive maintenance work include multi-modal data sources (e.g. text data describing failures combined with time series data from sensor), severe class imbalances due to existing maintenance processes, censored labels, and a general sparsity of labeled data. To overcome these challenges, work closely with end users and subject matter experts and use weak learning and weak supervision to rapidly construct large datasets, we use time series analysis to predict component failures, and use anomaly detection methods to discover outbreaks in the fleet."

    name: Radiation Safety
    anchor: radiation
    image: "/assets/images/rpm.png"
    blurb: "We develop algorithms for both detection and decision support in nuclear threat identification. Using our flagship Bayesian Aggregation method for source detection and characterization we are developing fast and efficient tools for situational awareness and safety applications. Our work focuses on robust methods, multi-sensor and multi-modal data fusion, and decision support infrastructure for rapidly processing alerts."

    name: Traffic & Public Safety
    anchor: traffic
    image: "/assets/images/traffic_craig.png"
    blurb: "Using traffic cameras placed around Pittsburgh city, we are working to identify anomalous vehicle  and pedestrian trajectories. Highlighting when people appear to be where they should not be supports decision making for autonomous vehicles. These cameras may also improve estimates of minor traffic incidents that do not result in police reports, informing city planning and allocation of resources for improving safety of intersections for vehicles and pedestrians."
