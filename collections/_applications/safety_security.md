title:  "Safety & Security"
summary: "Projects in this application area represent a variety of critical contexts for artificial intelligence and machine learning. Trust and understanding of the inner workings of models is an important step toward widespread deployment. Testing models to provide assurances of efficacy and safety encompasses both statistical and logical analyses. The Auton Lab not only makes an impact in Safety & Security by building state of the art AI, but also by informing policy decisions on how to ready complex, critical systems for a future where more insights and promise can be unlocked with AI."

    name: Predictive Maintenance
    anchor: pmx
    blurb: "Predictive Maintenance in the Auton Lab focuses on applying machine learning to complex, critical systems such as aircraft, spacecraft, automobiles, and biological systems. With over 15 years of experience in predictive maintenance, we focus on reducing risks of unforeseen issues, reducing false positives in detection systems, and forecasting future failures of individual components. Common challenges in our predictive maintenance work include multi-modal data sources (e.g. text data describing failures combined with time series data from sensor), severe class imbalances due to existing maintenance processes, censored labels, and a general sparsity of labeled data. To overcome these challenges, work closely with end users and subject matter experts and use weak learning and weak supervision to rapidly construct large datasets, we use time series analysis to predict component failures, and use anomaly detection methods to discover outbreaks in the fleet."

    name: Field Medicine
    anchor: tracir
    blurb: "Autonomous delivery of trauma care in the field is the Auton Lab contribution to the Trauma Care in a Rucksack (TRACIR) initiative, which is a joint research collaboration between the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. The goal is to produce an autonomous trauma care capability for prolonged casualty care in the field. The envisioned autonomous capability is to be used to treat injured soldiers and minimize casualties in remote operations scenarios where medical equipment and expertise may be in short supply."

    name: Radiation Safety
    anchor: radiation
    blurb: "We develop algorithms for both detection and decision support in radiation safety adjudication. Using our flagship Bayesian Aggregation method for source detection and characterization, we are developing fast and efficient tools for situational awareness and safety applications. Our work focuses on robust methods, multi-sensor and multi-modal data fusion, and decision support infrastructure for rapidly processing alerts. Other work in the lab focuses on increasing efficacy and safety of nuclear fusion reactors using Deep Reinforcement Learning."
