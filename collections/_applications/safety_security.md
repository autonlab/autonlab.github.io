title:  "Safety & Security"
summary: "Projects in this application area represent a variety of critical contexts for artificial intelligence and machine learning. Trust and understanding of the inner workings of models is an important step toward widespread deployment. Testing models to provide assurances of efficacy and safety encompasses both statistical and logical analyses. The Auton Lab not only makes an impact in Safety & Security by building state of the art AI, but also by informing policy decisions on how to ready complex, critical systems for a future where more insights and promise can be unlocked with AI."

    name: Predictive Maintenance of Equipment
    anchor: pmx
    image: "/assets/images/predictive.jpg"
    blurb: "Predictive Maintenance in the Auton Lab focuses on applying machine learning to complex, critical systems such as aircraft, spacecraft, automobiles, and biological systems. With over 15 years of experience in predictive maintenance, we focus on reducing risks of unforeseen issues, reducing false positives in detection systems, and forecasting future failures of individual components. Common challenges in our predictive maintenance work include multi-modal data sources (e.g. text data describing failures combined with time series data from sensor), severe class imbalances due to existing maintenance processes, censored labels, and a general sparsity of labeled data. To overcome these challenges, work closely with end users and subject matter experts and use weak learning and weak supervision to rapidly construct large datasets, we use time series analysis to predict component failures, and use anomaly detection methods to discover outbreaks in the fleet."

    name: Radiation Safety
    anchor: radiation
    image: "/assets/images/rpm.png"
    blurb: "We develop algorithms for both detection and decision support in nuclear threat identification. Using our flagship Bayesian Aggregation method for source detection and characterization we are developing fast and efficient tools for situational awareness and safety applications. Our work focuses on robust methods, multi-sensor and multi-modal data fusion, and decision support infrastructure for rapidly processing alerts."

    name: Traffic & Public Safety
    anchor: traffic

    blurb: "Identifying anomalous trajectories of pedestrians and highlighting when people appear to be where they should not be."
