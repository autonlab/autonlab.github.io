title:  "Safety & Security"
summary: "Our projects in this application area represent a variety of critical contexts for artificial intelligence and machine learning that are collaborations with industrial and government sponsors at the local, state, and federal level. In addition to deploying intelligent systems, part of the work in this context is defining ways to modernize existing processes to produce data that is AI-ready."

    name: Predictive Maintenance of Equipment
    anchor: pmx
    image: "/assets/images/predictive.jpg"
    blurb: "AI-driven Predictive Maintenance research in the Auton Lab focuses on applying artificial intelligence to assess the health of complex, critical systems such as aircraft, spacecraft, automobiles, or biological systems. With two decades of experience in this field, we focus on reducing risks of unforeseen issues, reducing false positives in problem detection systems, and forecasting future failures of individual components as well as complete systems. Common challenges include harnessing multi-modal data from disparate sources (e.g., textual maintenance records describing failures and corrective actions, combined with parametric time series data from sensors), severe class imbalances, since critical failures are usually very rare, censored labels, and a general sparsity of labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we work closely with end users and subject matter experts and use active and weak learning strategies,  we apply advanced time series analyses to forecast component failures, and use anomaly detection methods to discover unexpected systematic issues affecting fleets of approximately homogeneous equipment."

    name: Radiation Safety
    anchor: radiation
    image: "/assets/images/rpm.png"
    blurb: "We develop algorithms for both detection and decision support for radiation threat identification. Using our flagship Bayesian Aggregation framework designed for source detection and characterization in noisy environments, we build fast and efficient tools for enhanced situational awareness in safety applications. We develop models for harnessing data collected with mobile and stationary radiation sensors. Some of our tools are integrated in systems deployed to protect our borders from undocummented transportation of radioactive materials. Our research in this area focuses on robust methods, multi-sensor and multi-modal data fusion, and decision support infrastructure for rapidly processing radiation sensor alerts in the presence of substantial background radiation noise."

    name: Traffic & Public Safety
    anchor: traffic
    image: "/assets/images/traffic_craig.png"
    blurb: "Using traffic cameras placed around the city of Pittsburgh, we are working to identify anomalous vehicle and pedestrian trajectories. Erratic behavior may be a sign of health issues as a driver, walker or cyclist, or a result of reckless driving that endarges other participants of the city traffic.We aim to identify systematic yet correctable patterns of unexpected behaviors that may reduce safety, and inform city planning and redesign of traffic routes Discovering handicapped persons attempting to cross the street could be used to trigger a change of traffic lights at the intersection."
