Hi there! My name is Aleeya Babb. (Yes, that's me in the gif... not driving though, just a backseat ride of a lifetime!)

I've been with the Auton Lab since May 2022 when I was lucky enough to spend the summer as a helicopter maintenance consultant for the Preventative Maintenance projects. I have almost 6 years of experience in the Navy where I worked as an aviation electrician on FA-18s, EA-18Gs, and MH-60Rs, with most of my experience and expertise being in the latter platform.

Currently, I'm a Senior at the University of Pittsburgh in the College of Business Administration, where I'm pursuing a major in Business Marketing with a concentration in Business Information Systems. I graduate December 2023 :)

I have a passion for website design & development, as well as logo and graphic design, so keep an eye out for frequent updates to the website and other projects going on at the lab!

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn][1] if you'd like to chat!
