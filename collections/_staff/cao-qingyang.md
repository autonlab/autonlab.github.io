Hi, I am Sophia, an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University studying Statistics & Machine Learning and Computer Science. 

I have joined Auton Lab to work on building a labeling model for assessing patients' cardiovascular sufficient state during resuscitation, along with an interactive web tool for doctors to try different definitions of cardiovascular sufficiency. My mentors are Rachel Li, Gus Welter, and Professor Artur Dubrawski.
