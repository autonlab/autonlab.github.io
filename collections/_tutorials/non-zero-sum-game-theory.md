Auctions and electronic negotiations are a fascinating topic. These slides take you through most of the basic story of the assumptions, the formalism and the mathematics behind non-zero-sum game theory. It might help you to begin by reading the slides on <a href="/resources/tutorials/game-tree-search">game-tree search</a> and <a href="/resources/tutorials/zero-sum-game-theory">Zero-sum Game theory with Hidden information</a> available from this same set of tutorials. In this tutorial we cover the definition of a multiplayer non-zero-sum game, domination of strategies, Nash Equilibia. We deal with discrete games, and also games in which strategies include real numbers, such as your bid in a two player double auction negotiation. We cover prisoner's dilemma, tragedy of the commons, double auctions, and multi-player auctions such as the first price sealed auction and the second price auction. The math for the double auction analysis can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/double_auction_math.pdf">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/double_auction_math.pdf</a>.
