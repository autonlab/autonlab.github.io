This slide repeats much of the material of the main Probability Slide from Andrew's tutorial series, but this slide-set focusses on disease surveillance examples, and includes a very detailed description for non-experts about how Bayes rule is used in practice, about Bayes Classifiers, and how to learn Naive Bayes classifiers from data.
