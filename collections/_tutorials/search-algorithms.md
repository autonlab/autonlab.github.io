What is a search algorithm? What job does it do and where can it be applied? We introduce various flavors of Breadth First Search and Depth First search and then looks at alternatives and improvements that include Iterative Deepening and Bidirectional Search. Then we look with furrowed brow at an idea called Best First Search. This will be our first view of a search algorithm that is able to exploit a heuristic function.
