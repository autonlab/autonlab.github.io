A review of a world that you've probably encountered before: real-valued random variables, probability density functions, and how to deal with multivariate (i.e. high dimensional) probablity densities. Here's where you can review things like Expectations, Covariance Matrices, Independence, Marginal Distributions and Conditional Distributions. Once you're happy with this stuff you won't be a data miner, but you'll have the tools to very quickly become one.
