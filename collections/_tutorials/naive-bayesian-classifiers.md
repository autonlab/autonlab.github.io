I recommend using <a href="/resources/tutorials/probability-for-data-miners">Probability For Data Mining</a> for a more in-depth introduction to Density estimation and general use of Bayes Classifiers, with Naive Bayes Classifiers as a special case. But if you just want the executive summary bottom line on learning and using Naive Bayes classifiers on categorical attributes then these are the slides for you.
