PAC stands for "Probably Approximately Correct" and concerns a nice formalism for deciding how much data you need to collect in order for a given classifier to achieve a given probability of correct predictions on a given fraction of future test data. The resulting estimate is somewhat conservative but still represents an interesting avenue by which computer science has tried to muscle in on the kind of analytical problem that you would normally find in a statistics department.
