This simple tutorial overviews some methods for detecting anomalies in biosurveillance time series. The slides are incomplete: verbal commentary from the presentation has not yet been included as explanatory textboxes. Please let me (awm@cs.cmu.edu) know if you would be interested in more detail on these slides and/or access to the software that implements and graphs the various univariate methods. If I receive enough requests I will try to make both of the above available.
