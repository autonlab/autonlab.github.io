We review some algorithms for clever path planning once we arrive in real-valued continuous space instead of the safe and warm discrete space we've been sheltering in so far. We look at configuration spaces, visibility graphs, cell-decomposition, voronoi-based planning and potential field methods. Unfortunately some of the figures are missing from the PDF version.
