Over a century old, this form of data mining is still being used very intensively by statisticians and machine learners alike. We explore nearest neighbor learning, k-nearest-neighbor, kernel methods and locally weighted polynomial regression. Software and data for the algorithms in this tutorial are available from <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/vizier">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/vizier</a>. The example figures in this slide-set were created with the same software and data.
