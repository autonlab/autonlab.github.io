Introduction to algorithms for computer game playing. We describe the assumptions about two-player zero-sum discrete finite deterministic games of perfect information. We also practice saying that noun-phrase in a single breath. After the recovery teams have done their job we talk about solving such games with minimax and then alpha-beta search. We also discuss the dynamic programming approach, used most commonly for end-games. We also debate the theory and practice of heuristic evaluation functions in games.
