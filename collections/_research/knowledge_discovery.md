summary: "Using AI to discover structure in data. This structure can be leveraged to learn something new about the data itself, furthering the science of the field.  Insight can also be used to inform design decisions and engineer the best model possible. Intelligibility of the discovered knowledge is critical, as it facilitates communication of results and ensures that all insights generated are actionable."

    blurb: "Leveraging hidden structure in data informs design decisions in modeling paradigms and expands the set of possibilities for building useful models. Uncovering patterns that are obfuscated by class imbalance, or assumptions of homogeneity. Data-driven discovery of formal specifications that could be useful in demonstrating the trustworthiness of a model to a human user."

    blurb: "Capturing rare events in data also provides leads for investigation to understand the environmental conditions under which a model performs well or poorly. Data-centric anomalies describe events that are rare and Model-centric anomalies describe fault modes.  Combining data and model centric anomaly detection not only allows us to talk about low error rates, but also the ways in which those rare events will manifest, circumventing the need to discover faults empirically where otherwise easily preventable harm can be inflicted."
