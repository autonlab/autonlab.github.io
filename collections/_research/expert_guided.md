title:  "Expert-Guided Machine Learning"
summary: "Auton Lab research frequently involves ways to incorporate expert knowledge into AI systems. This ranges from research on how to effectively have experts label vast amounts of data, to incorporating feedback in active learning frameworks, to formal verification of model adherence to domain-specific constraints and design specifications."

  - 
    name: Weak Supervision
    anchor: weasel
    blurb: "Many state of the art models have a voracious appetite for labeled data, which is hard to provide in contexts where subject matter experts are the only people capable of providing annotations. The weak supervision paradigm replaces labeling of individual data samples with the creation of labeling functions. Auton lab work expands this paradigm to increase the efficiency and flexibility of the data programming framework."
  -
    name: Data Mining & Anomaly Detection
    anchor: data
    blurb: "Leveraging hidden structure in data informs design decisions in modeling paradigms and expands the set of possibilities for building useful models. Capturing rare events in data also provides leads for investigation to understand the environmental conditions under which a model performs well or poorly."
  -
    name: Specification-Driven AI
    anchor: informed
    blurb: "The utility of machine learning is that it will learn useful policies from data, however it is an open question of how to incorporate domain-specific constraints into the training process. Auton Lab works to help SMEs to codify their knowledge in a way that informs the model fitting process, including physics informed algorithms, as well as informing the testing process, including model-centric verification of adherence to design specifications and statistical evaluation of business emtrics."
