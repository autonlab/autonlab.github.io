AutonML is an automated machine learning system developed by CMU Auton Lab to power data scientists with efficient model discovery and advanced data analytics. The purpose of AutonML is to multiply capacity of Data Scientists by automating searches for plausible modeling process designs. It can help address shortages of qualified personnel and boost productivity of current staff. This open source software leverages DARPA D3M ecosystem; it can be run from the command line and produces Python code for the users to prime their solutions; it can be integrated with other productivity tools and GUIs built for non-experts.
