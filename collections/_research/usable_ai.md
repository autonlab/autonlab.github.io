title:  "Making AI Usable & Accessible"
splash: "/assets/images/usable_ai.jpg"
summary: "These research thrusts address the pain points of applying ML in practice.  AI research that is informed by constant exposure to real-world, domain-specific constraints including resource limits, privacy considerations, and user trust & understanding."

    name: Automated Machine Learning
    anchor: autonml
    image: "/assets/images/AutonML2.png"
    blurb: "AutonML augments the capacity of Data Scientists by automating searches for plausible modeling process designs. It can help address shortages of qualified personnel and boost productivity of current staff by automatically learning what is learnable from data. Increasingly, state-of-the-art AI systems require infrastructure which makes their application limited to organizations with vast amounts of resources.  Auton Lab works to make these data-hungry learning paradigms more efficient so that our models may be applied to contexts where abundance of data is not easily obtained, allowing those who would otherwise be left behind to unlock the promise of AI in their critical contexts.  Auton Lab also works to automate much for the process of cleaning data, discovering learnable parameters, training models, and tuning hyperparameters.  Such work reduces the need for experienced data scientists to be involved in the model development process, and gives more agency to people who want to use AI in effective ways."

    name: Distributed AI
    anchor: federated
    image: "/assets/images/federated_hospital.png"
    blurb: "Federated Learning supports machine learning in a distributed manner, by learning on local data and updating global model parameters. Federated Learning is particularly applicable in cases where local datasets either have ownership and privacy considerations or the sheer amount of data is not supportive of centralized model learning. Distribution of compute resources to where the data resides also allows local models to learn idiosyncratic structure from each locality, complementing the structure that emerges in the global model."

    name: Efficient Data Structures and Learning Algorithms
    anchor: structure
    image: "/assets/images/ssr_data_structure.jpg"
    blurb: "Intelligent data structures can support fast queries for information that may otherwise take a long time to compute, such as temporal scans and robustness guarantees. Reducing the resource cost of deep learning algorithms through efficient sampling and by replacing internal network structure with more light-weight alternatives, such as fuzzy decision trees. Adaptive resolution temporal scans to answer user queries. Disjunctive anomaly detection."

    name: Explainable & Trustworthy AI
    anchor: xai
    image: "/assets/images/trustworthy_ai_workflow.jpg"
    blurb: "If understanding, performance, and trust are integral to the adoption of AI in new, mission-critical fields, a model's inability to rationalize its behavior is rate-limiting. If users cannot supervise AI systems, there is a non-trivial chance that AI will inflict otherwise easily preventable harm to humans. Auton Lab develops a variety of tools which are intended to give the developers of AI systems a better understanding of what their models actually learn.  In developing AI systems for subject matter experts (SMEs), it is important to demonstrate that AI learns a policy that resonates with human decision making in easy-to-adjudicate cases.  Proving that AI has learned 'common sense' patterns in data requires that our systems be both explainable and interrogable. Common sense properties of AI systems may include algorithmic fairness in applications that deal with human data. Auton Lab develops methods for determining whether a trained model exhibits unfair bias, which not only informs decision making at model deployment, but also in a streaming manner as deployed models make new predictions."
