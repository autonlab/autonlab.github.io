title:  "Pragmatic Deep Learning"
splash: "/assets/images/pragmatic_deep_learning.jpg"
summary: "Some of the contemporary limitations of deep learning can be traced back to the fields early days. At Auton Lab, we try to unlock the same benefits of deep learning with novel approaches that reduce the complexity or the appetite for data. Additionally, a goal is to increase interpretability by keeping models as simple. This thrust involves building new model classes that are capable of deep learning while possessing structural advantages that make the methods applicable in select real-world contexts."

    blurb: "Auton Lab works on methods to build autoencoders with fewer parameters than deep network alternatives, trading fidelity for scalability. This work enables accurate forecasting for long windows into the future. Variational autoencoders break the assumption of independence among subsequent layers in the network. That reduces complexity of the model but maintains performance. Reduces time to train, resource consumption, etc."

    blurb: "Current trends in Reinforcement Learning require massive amounts of data and compute power. Work on the Auton Lab makes RL more efficient and accessible to researchers to push its limits and answer new questions. Sample efficient reinforcement learning, learning with genetic curriculum."
