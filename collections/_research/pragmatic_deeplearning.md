    blurb: "Auton Lab works on methods to build autoencoders with fewer parameters than deep network alternatives, trading fidelity for scalability. This work enables accurate forecasting for long windows into the future. Variational autoencoders break the assumption of independence among subsequent layers in the network. That reduces complexity of the model but maintains performance. Reduces time to train, resource consumption, etc."
