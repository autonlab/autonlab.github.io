summary: "Research at the intersection of the benefits of deep learning and real-world constraints that limit the effectiveness of standard methods"
projects:
  - 
    name: Hybrid Forecasting
    anchor: forecasting
    image: "/assets/images/nhits.jpg"
    blurb: "Incorporating exogenous variables to reduce forecasting error. Learning heirarchical, structural elements of data to aid in forecasting."
  -
    name: Deep Survival Analysis
    anchor: survival
    image: "/assets/images/deep_survival_models.jpg"
    blurb: "Predicting time to failure under censored outcomes. Discovering effective interventions under assumptions of heterogeneity."
  -
    name: Bayesian Deep Learning
    anchor: vaes
    image: "/assets/images/autoencoder_diagram.png"
    blurb: "Auton Lab works on methods to build autoencoders with fewer parameters than deep network alternatives, trading fidelity for scalability. This work enables accurate forecasting for long windows into the future. Variational autoencoders break the assumption of independence among subsequent layers in the network. That reduces complexity of the model but maintains performance. Reduces time to train, resource consumption, etc."
  -
    name: Efficient, Deep Reinforcement Learning
    anchor: deeprl
    image: "/assets/images/genetic_curriculum.gif"
    blurb: "Current trends in Reinforcement Learning require massive amounts of data and compute power. Work on the Auton Lab makes RL much more efficient and accessible to researchers to push its limits and answer new questions without requiring massive computing infrastructure. Sample efficient reinforcement learning, learning with genetic curriculum."
