title:  "Informed Machine Learning"
splash: "/assets/images/informed_ml.jpg"
summary: "Auton Lab research frequently involves ways to incorporate expert knowledge into AI systems. We recognize that simply studying the data, model, and predictions is an unnecessarily limiting perspective because these factors are informed by upstream conditions, knowledge, and design choices. Figuring out how to incorporate this upstream knowledge into AI systems represents a huge opportunity to guide AI to learning data-driven policy that also respects common sense norms. Work in this context ranges from research on how to effectively have experts label vast amounts of data, to incorporating feedback in active learning frameworks, to formal verification of model adherence to domain-specific constraints and design specifications. We take AI outside the cozy spot of data-driven approach. Standard AI relies primarily on what can be learned from data, however, data is just a limited projection of reality. Auton lab is working on multiple exciting avenues to make AI and ML smarter."
projects:
  - 
    name: "Weak Supervision"
    anchor: weasel
    image: "/assets/images/weak_supervision.jpg"
    blurb: "Many state of the art models have a voracious appetite for labeled data, which is hard to provide in contexts where subject matter experts are the only people capable of providing annotations. The weak supervision paradigm replaces labeling of individual data samples with the creation of labeling functions. Auton lab work expands this paradigm to increase the efficiency and flexibility of the data programming framework."

    name: "Active Search"
    anchor: maas
    image: "/assets/images/multiagent_active_search.jpg"
    blurb: "Multi-Agent Active Search (MAAS) refers to the problem of coordinating a team of agents to actively search for a sparse set of targets in an unknown domain. MAAS applications include robotic search-and-rescue, gas-leak detection, military reconnaissance and disaster relief. Despite the recent interest in MAAS technologies, pilots often face significant coordination challenges, preventing the effective deployment of drones in the field. Consequently, Auton Lab focuses on developing algorithms and theory to help enable next generation MAAS applications."

    name: "Principle-Driven AI"
    anchor: principle
    image: "/assets/images/weak_heuristics.jpg"
    blurb: "Leveraging domain knowledge; leveraging first principles of physics/chemistry/biology; leveraging common sense and demonstrating common sense. The utility of machine learning is that it will learn useful policies from data, however it is an open question of how to incorporate domain-specific constraints into the training process. Auton Lab works to help SMEs to codify their knowledge in a way that informs the model fitting process, including physics informed algorithms."

    name: "Introspective AI"
    anchor: selfaware
    image: "/assets/images/global_individual_fairness.jpg"
    blurb: "Models should be conscious of their own decision logic, and able to admit what they can and cannot do. Through formal verification, we can provide formal guarantees whether a trained model exhibits fair decision making globally, whether a model exhibits robustness to imperceptible perturbations on input, and whether a model adheres to safety-paramount engineering constraints. In cases where these properties are violated, returning explicit environmental conditions that cause the violation lets the model admit when it can or cannot be trusted. This information may also help the model learn from its past mistakes, iteratively producing a model that better adheres to critical design specifications."
